# My Notes
Simple little desktop app to save a diary of work or tasks done; I use this to remind me of things I've done to possibly put in my resume or blog


# Requires
Python 3.x


# How to
  - Rename the file __items-example.txt__ to __items.txt__ 
  - Add a project/task on a new line in __items.txt__ 
  - Run the project using "__python mynotes.py__" 
  - Select the project from the dropdown, add a quick note and press __Save Note__
  - The note is saved in a file called __Project name.txt__ with date/time and note; newest notes are aded to the top

# Plans
No *big* plans for this project. Minor tweaks here and there. Some thoughts:
1. Add a method to add projects/tasks to __items.txt__ without manually editing
1. Possibly a way to view current notes in a way to not have to open TXT files manually
